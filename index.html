      <p>I invite you to walk with me, to share what you can in creating a world where women can live without fear. Where <strong>women</strong> have enough for themselves and their children, where women care about each otherâ€™s wellbeing and not who wears the smallest dress size.</p>
      <p>We must as women, if we plan to ever receive true equality and live without fear or as a minority, create sisterhood, defend each other and leave the competition and petty mind set behind, step forward hand in hand and show the world we are <strong>united</strong>.</p>
